        Thousands of Indian IT professionals in the U.S. who lost their jobs due to the series of recent lay-offs at companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon are now struggling to find new employment within the stipulated period under their work visas to stay in the country.
        According to The Washington Post, nearly 2,00,000 IT workers have been laid off since November last year, including some record numbers at companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.
     </p>
     <p>
        As per some industry insiders, between 30% to 40% of them are Indian IT professionals, a significant number of whom are on H-1B and L1 visas.
     </p>
        The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in special occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.
        L-1A and L-1B visas are available for temporary intracompany transferees who work in managerial positions or have specialised knowledge.
     <p>
        A significantly large number of Indian IT professionals, who are on non-immigrant work visas like H-1B and L1, are now scrambling for options to stay in the U.S. to find a new job in the stipulated few months that they get under these foreign work visas after losing their jobs and changing their visa status as well.

        Amazon staffer Gita (name changed) arrived in the U.S. only three months ago. This week she was told that March 20 is her last working day.
    </p>
     <p>
        The situation is getting worse for those on H-1B visas as they have to find a new job within 60 days or else, they would be left with no other option but to head back to India.
        Under current circumstances, when all IT companies are on a firing spree, getting a job within that short period, they feel it is next to impossible.

        Sita (name changed), another IT professional on an H-1B visa, got laid off from Microsoft on January 18.
